Hello world, I am a software engineer working in High Performance Computing.
Currently I am with the [OLCF](http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/) working as their
Software Czar. That's the fancy name for the person who decides what software
will be installed center-wide and gets things done. The OLCF is the name given
to the department responsible for marinating all supercomputers a Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (ORNL).

My background is Computer Science but recently, I've taken a liking to hardware
design and construction. Most of my posts here will cover that topic.

Thanks for stopping by!
