Hello world, I am a software engineer working in High Performance Computing.
Currently I am with the [OLCF](http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/) working as their
Software Czar. That's the fancy name for the person who decides what software
will be installed center-wide and gets things done. The OLCF is the name given
to the department responsible for marinating all supercomputers a Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (ORNL). It's the most recent name chosen, previously known
as [NCCS](http://www.nccs.gov/).

My background is Computer Science, for details please see my resume. Recently,
I've taken a liking to hardware design and construction. Most of my posts here
will cover that topic.

Thanks for stopping by!
