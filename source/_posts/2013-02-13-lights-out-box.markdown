Over the past year I've been working on my first big hardware project. It
started as an experiment in powering and controlling led displays. I love the
blinky lights and wanted something big that would catch the eye.

[{% img /images/lights_out/IMG_3852.JPG Lights Out %}](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jtv7i2y51uckmn1/6SccJowgE1/Full%20Size#f:IMG_3852.JPG)

The end result is a tabletop sized arcade for a 4x4 lights out game similar in
gameplay to the
[Mini Lights out Game](http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/lights.htm#descmini)
by Tiger Electronics.

This project took me a long while to complete due to lack of free time. I began
when my son turned one year old and finished not long before he turned two. The
effort paid off though and I'm happy with how it turned out.

### Demo

### Parts

I took the lego approach while putting this together. Pick powerful components
and wire them up. Here is a list of every part used and what I paid for it.

Most of these parts are overkill and I'm sure this project could be accomplished
cheaper and more efficiently. Some parts don't seem to be available anymore.
Even so, it has a lot of character and thats what I was going for.

Here you can see the layout of the components. I couldn't find a through hole
protoboard that was large enough to accommodate all of the alphanumeric digits so
I fastened two together and used some legos attached to with screws for
reinforcement.

[{% img /images/lights_out/IMG_3878.JPG Board Layout %}](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jtv7i2y51uckmn1/6SccJowgE1/Full%20Size#f:IMG_3878.JPG)

{% img right /images/lights_out/MAX6954_Connection_Circuit.png MAX6954 Connection Circuit %}

Below the alphanumeric digits are the MAX6954 drivers. There is one driver per
row. Next to each driver are decoupling capacitors and a resistor for limiting
the current to each segment. The diagram to the right details the required
connections.

The MAX6954 datasheet claims they are chainable but I was getting garbage on the
second display when wiring the SPI bus in a chain. It worked much better when
each chip had it's own chip select line and I sent commands to both or one at a
time.

Connecting each chip to 8 digits was the hardest part of this build.  Wire
wrapping that many connections took about 6hrs total. Below is the connection
scheme in a table from the datasheet. The chip uses charlie-plexing to control
that many segments.

### Build

I chose to wire wrap the whole thing because I wasn't 100% sure how to connect
everything to start with. I'm also lacking a proper circuit schematic. Learing
how to use Eagle or gEDA is still on my todo list.

### Solving a Game

A [post on Merlin's magic square](http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Games/Merlin4x4.shtml#theory)
at cut-the-knot.org pointed me to an article in Mathematics Magazine, Vol. 74
[An Easy Solution to Mini Lights Out(pp. 57-59) Jennie Missigman and Richard Weida](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2691157)
The gist of this article points out a few unique properties of 4x4 lights out games that are periodic (wrap around).

1. Every game is solvable
2. The order of buttons pressed does not matter
3. The solution to any game can be found by multiplying a matrix by a column
   vector that represents the status of the board. 1's represent lights turned
   on, 0's off.

Armed with this knowledge I was able to add random levels (which are all
solvable), a solution function, and the total number of moves required to win.

Unfortunately, it turns out that random levels are extremely hard to win because
they have absolutely no pattern that makes sense. To address that I wanted to
include the original levels that were part of the
[Mini Lights out Game](http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/lights.htm#descmini).
You can find them at
[Mini Lights Out Levels and Solutions](http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/extra/lomini.txt) on
[Jaap's Puzzle Page](http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/lightsol.htm#lomini).

### Code

The [Lights Out Arduino Sketch](https://github.com/AnthonyDiGirolamo/lightsout)
is pretty well organized. I've also written a
[library for controlling the MAX6954's](https://github.com/AnthonyDiGirolamo/MAX6954).
which keeps the lights out code simpler.

The sketch is organized into separate files. When compiled in the Arduino IDE
the files are concatenated and then compiled as a single source file. The
lights out and color chooser functions are broken out into their own classes.
All strings and levels are stored in program memory.

Each level, and the state of the board, is represented by a 16-bit unsigned
integer. Litterally 16 1's or 0's. This makes it takeup very little space. To
compute a solution for a given board a matrix vector multiplication needs to be
performed. The 16x16 matrix is composed of only 1's and 0's so to save space I
store it as an array of 16 bit integers.

{% codeblock Matrix for solving a given lights out game lang:c https://github.com/AnthonyDiGirolamo/lightsout/blob/master/lightsout_01_vars.ino Source File %}
// This is a matrix of 1's and 0's packed into 16 bit integers

Packing the matrix value like this adds a bit of code to the matrix vector
multiply. It's still quite readable though. If you are unfamiliar with bitmath
checkout [The Arduino Playground Bit Math Tutorial](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/BitMath)
and [Bit Twiddling Hacks](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html)

{% codeblock Matrix Vector Multiply lang:c https://github.com/AnthonyDiGirolamo/lightsout/blob/master/lightsout_04_lights_out_class.ino Source File %}
uint16_t find_solution() {
  uint16_t a, b, x, solution;
  solution = 0;
  for(int r=0; r<16; r++) {
    x = 0;
    for(int c=15; c>=0; c--) {
      a = (solving_matrix[r] & space_masks[c]) >> (c); // Unpack matrix value
      b = (current_board & space_masks[c]) >> (c); // Unpack level value
      x += (a*b);
    }
    x %= 2;
    solution |= (x << (15-r)); // Pack
  }
  return solution;
}
{% endcodeblock %}

As a side note, it's pretty easy to convert number bases in your editor if you
can filter text through an external program. This is trivial in vim and is
possible with other editors like TextMate. In vim, I filter the following text
through `bc` "An arbitrary precision calculator language" available on almost
any Linux distribution and MacOSX. The first two lines tell bc to output base 16
and take base 2 as input (they should be set in that order).

{% codeblock Base 2 input %}
obase=16;ibase=2
1101100000001000
1110010000000100
0111001000000010
1011000100000001
1000110110000000
0100111001000000
0010011100100000
0001101100010000

0100000001001110
0010000000100111
0001000000011011
{% endcodeblock %}

The result, instant base 16 without leaving the editor!

### Improvements:

If I were to build this whole thing again from scratch I would make these
changes:

* Design a circuit board instead of wire wrapping
* Tab-in-slot method enclosure
* Better arcade buttons with a more clicky feel
* Better way of fastening the RGB LEDs to the buttons
* A red contrast filter for the 17 segment characters
