Recently I've been trying out emacs to see what it's like on the other side.
These posts have been a good resource getting started:

- [Emacs as My \<Leader\>: Evil-mode](http://bling.github.io/blog/2013/10/16/emacs-as-my-leader-evil-mode/)
- [Emacs as My \<Leader\>: Vim Survival
  Guide](http://bling.github.io/blog/2013/10/27/emacs-as-my-leader-vim-survival-guide/)

My `emacs.d` folder is stored [here](https://github.com/AnthonyDiGirolamo/configs/tree/master/emacs/emacs.d).

Here is my `~/.emacs.d/init.el` file for reference:

{% include_code lang:lisp init.el %}
